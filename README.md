# Bayesian Machine Scientist Projec

## Overview
This project implements a **Bayesian Machine Scientist** to aid in the discovery of interpretable mathematical models from data. The approach leverages **Bayesian inference**, **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling**, and **model selection criteria** to automatically identify mathematical expressions that best describe a given dataset.

## Features
- Implements a **Bayesian approach** to model discovery
- Utilizes **MCMC** for efficient exploration of mathematical expression space
- Uses a **prior probability distribution** learned from scientific mathematical expressions
- Supports **automatic model selection** based on Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)
- Compares results against **existing machine learning methods**
